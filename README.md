## :scroll: Description
This app implements the design brief set in week 3 of the Compose Android Dev Challenge

All UI is written in Compose for week 3 of the Android Dev Challenge: Compose [#AndroidDevChallenge](https://developer.android.com/dev-challenge)

Designs can be found here ~> [https://github.com/android/android-dev-challenge-compose/blob/assets/MySoothe.zip](https://github.com/android/android-dev-challenge-compose/blob/assets/MySoothe.zip)

## :bulb: Motivation and Context
Great to implement a design from a spec with multiple elements including things like;
- Edit text
- Images (vectors)
- Buttons
- Scrolling lists
- Bottom navigation
- Themes, colours & custom fonts
